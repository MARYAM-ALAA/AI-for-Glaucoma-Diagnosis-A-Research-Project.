# AI-Based Glaucoma Diagnosis (Theoretical Model)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository presents a **theoretical framework** for an **AI-driven glaucoma diagnosis model**. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, often detected too late due to the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. Our proposed model aims to leverage **deep learning and machine learning techniques** to assist in early detection.

**⚠️ Note:** This project is currently a **conceptual plan** and has not been implemented yet. Future updates will focus on transitioning from theory to practice.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an **AI-based diagnostic tool** for glaucoma detection.
- Utilize **retinal images and clinical data** as model inputs.
- Improve diagnostic accuracy and accessibility using AI.
- Address limitations of current diagnostic techniques.

## 🏗️ Proposed Model Architecture

### **🔹 Inputs**
- **Retinal fundus images** (to detect optic nerve abnormalities).
- **Clinical parameters** (e.g., intraocular pressure (IOP), cup-to-disc ratio (CDR)).

### **🔹 Processing**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** To analyze retinal images.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** To classify clinical parameters.
- **Data Preprocessing Techniques:** Image enhancement and augmentation.

### **🔹 Outputs**
- **Prediction of glaucoma presence or absence** based on input features.
- **Statistical insights** on the correlation between clinical parameters and glaucoma.
